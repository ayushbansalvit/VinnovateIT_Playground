# VinnovateIT 🐛
We are a family and we believe in mutual development. This repository is made to learn developing projects in a team and understand the complete functioning of github. 
 
## Working
A Project will be decided and the whole development process will be divided into parts.

From then on , small tasks within each part will be assigned to the member via creation of issues. 

Admins can guide and suggest through comments and analyse the progress.

The members are expected to send Pull requests with a detailed title and description and admins will review and merge. 

## I'm a social animal!

So connect with me and share your experience.
